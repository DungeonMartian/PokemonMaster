This is the project files for the Slay the Spire mod "The Pokemon Master"

Currently, this is a work in progress and is made by two people. Most of the card art is from the Pokemon 
TCG, with a couple made by me and several being generated with craiyon, most of the other art is made by me with some wonderful power art by one of my contributors.

Here's the set up you'll need to do to get this to work.
