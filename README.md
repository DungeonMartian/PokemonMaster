This is the project files for the Slay the Spire mod "The Pokemon Master"

Currently, this is a work in progress and is largely by myself with some large contributions by Chrischu. Most of the card art is from the Pokemon 
TCG, with a couple made by me and several being generated with craiyon, most of the other art is made by me with some wonderful power art by Sabinmoon.

Here's the set up you'll need to do to get this to work.
