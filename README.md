This is the project files for the Slay the Spire mod "The Pokemon Master"

Currently, this is a work in progress and is made by two people. All the card art is from the Pokemon 
TCG, most of the other art made by me and some wonderful power art by one of my contributors.

Here's the set up you'll need to do to get this to work.
